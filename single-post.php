					<p>During my undergrad years at Virginia Tech, I had a Korean roommate who essentially had every piece of technology you could imagine crammed into our small dorm room.  While the living space was rather cramped, I was able to pick up a few things in terms of study habits and methods to help refresh the mind and stimulate good thought.</p>

					<p>My roommates name was Jay and being from Korea, he was able to bring a lot of the Korean culture to our dorm room.  Let me say this before getting into the purpose of this post, the food is amazing!  Our room smelled like heaven thanks to all the different meals he would make on a daily basis.</p>
