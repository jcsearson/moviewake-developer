Using the stripped Wordpress theme "Casper" (https://github.com/lacymorrow/casper-wp), this was designed for intent of use with MovieWake.com, a database where "above average" films can be archived.

## Tasks ##

Any CSS was combed, linted, prefixed, and compiled into css/style.css.
Images in images/main were compressed and copied to images/main.
JavaScript and other js files in js/main were linted, minified, and combined into js/global-min.js.
